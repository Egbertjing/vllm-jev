# User guide

Serve Jev models with vLLM. Send text or images and questions; receive labels, probabilities, yes/no answers, or scores.

## Installation

On Linux with an NVIDIA GPU, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). From a clone of this repository:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install .
```

For development, use `uv pip install -e .` to install from your working tree.

## Quickstart

Choose a supported Hugging Face model ID:

```bash
vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B
```

The command downloads and prepares the model, then starts the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8795`. Check it from another terminal:

```bash
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:8795/health
```

## Supported models

Input support depends on the model:

| Model | Input | Start server |
|---|---|---|
| [ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B](https://huggingface.co/ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B) | Text | `vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B` |
| [ZefanCai/Open-Jev-9B](https://huggingface.co/ZefanCai/Open-Jev-9B) | Text | `vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-9B` |
| [IamBusy/OpenJev-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/IamBusy/OpenJev-0.6B) | Text | `vllm-jev serve IamBusy/OpenJev-0.6B` |
| [lostargon/Tiny-Jev](https://huggingface.co/lostargon/Tiny-Jev) | Text | `vllm-jev serve lostargon/Tiny-Jev` |
| [Valen-Team/Valen-Preview-0923](https://huggingface.co/Valen-Team/Valen-Preview-0923) | Text + images | `vllm-jev serve Valen-Team/Valen-Preview-0923` |
| [yah01/vjev-vision](https://huggingface.co/yah01/vjev-vision) | Text + images | `vllm-jev serve yah01/vjev-vision` |
| [yah01/vjev-vision-pilot](https://huggingface.co/yah01/vjev-vision-pilot) | Text + images | `vllm-jev serve yah01/vjev-vision-pilot` |

Use `yah01/vjev-vision` for the current vjev release; the pilot is an earlier checkpoint. Both were trained on single images.

Image requests use `/v1/systemone`: up to 8 PNG/JPEG images, 8 MiB per image. Video input is not supported.

## Serving options

Choose a GPU or pass regular vLLM options after the model ID:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B --port 9000
```

The default port is 8795 and the GPU memory budget is 90%. The default maximum sequence length is 4,096 tokens, or 8,192 for Valen. Run `vllm-jev serve --help=all` to see additional vLLM options.

Set `HF_HOME` for the Hugging Face base-model cache. Set `VLLM_JEV_HOME` for the downloaded Jev files and prepared model; its default is `.local/` in your current directory.

## HTTP API

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/systemone` | Choice, Noul (yes/no), and Score for all supported models. |
| `POST /plugins/vllm-jev/choice` | One multiple-choice question for text models. |
| `POST /plugins/vllm-jev/batch` | A batch of multiple-choice questions for text models. |

Noul and Score are question types on `/v1/systemone`. One request supports up to 64 questions and 256 candidates.

### Choice

Send a `state`, `question`, and 2–255 `options`:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8795/plugins/vllm-jev/choice \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state":"A customer was charged twice and requests a refund.","question":"What is the issue?","options":["billing","technical","shipping"]}'
```

Read the selected label from `choice` and the distribution from `probabilities`. You can set an optional `temperature` to scale the probabilities.

### Noul (yes/no)

Put a `noul` question under `questions`:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8795/v1/systemone \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state":"A customer was charged twice and requests a refund.","questions":{"urgent":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Does this require urgent action?"}}}'
```

`answers.urgent.noul` is the probability of yes, between 0 and 1.

### Score

Provide 2–10 ordered levels from lowest to highest:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8795/v1/systemone \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state":"A customer was charged twice and requests a refund.","questions":{"severity":{"type":"score","instructions":"How severe is it?","criteria":["low","medium","high"]}}}'
```

`answers.severity.score` is the expected level. Levels start at zero, so this example returns a score between 0 and 2. The level distribution is in `answers.severity.probabilities`.

To ask several types together, put multiple entries in the same `questions` map. For a Choice question on this route, use `"type":"choice"` and a `criteria` map from labels to descriptions, as in the [README example](../README.md#example).

### Batch Choice

The batch route accepts up to 64 Choice questions and 256 candidates total:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8795/plugins/vllm-jev/batch \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"state":"The sky is blue.","question":"Choose the true statement.","options":["The sky is blue","The sky is green"]},{"state":"The grass is green.","question":"Choose the true statement.","options":["The grass is green","The grass is blue"]}]}'
```

The reply has one Choice result per request under `results`, in the same order.

### Text and images

Start Valen or either vjev model from the table above. Put image data URLs in `state.messages`; use a `state` string for text-only requests. For a local PNG:

```python
import base64
import json
import urllib.request

image = base64.b64encode(open("image.png", "rb").read()).decode()
request = {
    "state": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/png;base64,{image}"}},
        {"type": "text", "text": "Look at this image."},
    ]}]},
    "questions": {"color": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "What color is the object?", "criteria": {"red": "Red", "blue": "Blue"}}},
}
body = json.dumps(request).encode()
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8795/v1/systemone"
response = urllib.request.urlopen(urllib.request.Request(url, body, {"Content-Type": "application/json"}))
print(json.load(response)["answers"]["color"])
```

`answers.color` contains `choice`, `confidence`, and `probabilities`. The same image request can include Noul and Score questions.
