## About

vLLM Jev serves compatible Jev-style checkpoints through [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). Give it a question and candidate answers; it returns a label and a probability for each candidate.

- **Native vLLM serving:** scheduling, batching, compilation, KV cache, and metrics.
- **Native decision readouts:** scalar candidate branches or marker-token scores, selected from the model format.
- **Structured decisions:** Choice, Noul (yes/no), and Score (ordered levels) over HTTP.
- **Automatic setup:** give the launcher a supported Hugging Face model ID; it selects and verifies the native protocol. Serving does not train.

## Getting Started

Install vLLM Jev with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) from the repository directory:

```bash
uv pip install .
```

For development, use an [editable installation](docs/guide.md#installation).

Start a server with a supported Hugging Face model ID:

```bash
vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B
```

The command downloads and prepares the model, then starts native vLLM at `http://127.0.0.1:8795`. Later runs reuse the prepared checkpoint.

<summary>GPU, port, and serving options</summary>

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.90 --port 8795
```

Add standard `vllm serve` flags to override the defaults. See [serving options](docs/guide.md#serving-options) for cache paths, protocol selection, and the equivalent native command.

## Supported Models

Choose a model and run its command:

| Model | Start server |
|---|---|
| [ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B](https://huggingface.co/ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B) | `vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-2B` |
| [ZefanCai/Open-Jev-9B](https://huggingface.co/ZefanCai/Open-Jev-9B) | `vllm-jev serve ZefanCai/Open-Jev-9B` |
| [IamBusy/OpenJev-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/IamBusy/OpenJev-0.6B) | `vllm-jev serve IamBusy/OpenJev-0.6B` |
| [lostargon/Tiny-Jev](https://huggingface.co/lostargon/Tiny-Jev) | `vllm-jev serve lostargon/Tiny-Jev` |

## Example

With the server running, send a Choice request:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8795/v1/systemone \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state":"I was charged twice and want a refund.","questions":{"intent":{"type":"choice","instructions":"Choose the customer intent.","criteria":{"billing":"A payment or refund issue","technical":"A malfunction or setup issue","other":"Another request"}}}}'
```

The response contains `answers.intent.choice` and `answers.intent.probabilities` for the supplied labels.

See the [HTTP route map](docs/guide.md#http-api) for Choice, Noul, and Score requests. The [integration guide](docs/guide.md) also covers model export, storage paths, vLLM options, and multi-GPU serving. The plugin targets **vLLM 0.29.0** and **Python 3.12+**.

## Hosted inference performance

Each row uses the same model, input, and GPU for both endpoints. Lower latency and higher throughput are better.

Paired values: **Without vLLM Jev → With vLLM Jev**.

Measured on one A800 GPU, with the author and vLLM Jev services run **sequentially**. Each row is one four-option Choice question, 8 warm-up requests, then 64 measured HTTP requests; short and long states contain 67 and 2,058 characters. Latency is the median client latency; p95 means 95% of requests finished within that time. Throughput is completed requests divided by wall time. Every run succeeded **64/64** and both endpoints selected the same option on this repeated test input. Model loading and compilation are excluded.

¹ The author’s published Linux server runs this model on **CPU**. For a same-GPU comparison, a benchmark-only HTTP service moved its original branch scorer to CUDA and cast the backbone to BF16; the scoring code was unchanged. The published CPU server, with its declared Transformers 4.57.6 / PEFT 0.18.0 versions, was also measured: p50 was 667 ms (short) and 1,880 ms (long) at concurrency 1. At concurrency 8, its CPU throughput was 1.48 req/s (short) and 0.53 req/s (long). CPU values are excluded from the speedup columns.

² Tiny-Jev publishes a Python inference API, not an HTTP server. The baseline uses that API behind a minimal benchmark-only HTTP service on the same GPU. The shim serializes calls, as do the other author services.

The Open-Jev 2B/9B author servers used their `--prefix-cache` option and the projects' pinned Transformers 5.10.2 / PEFT 0.19.1 versions. Their optional flash-linear-attention kernels were unavailable, so Transformers used its torch reference path. vLLM Jev used its documented default compiled, async, 90% GPU-memory launch. At concurrency 8, gains include queueing in the author HTTP services and vLLM batching; they are serving-path gains, not isolated kernel speedups. The repeated requests do not measure model accuracy or cross-model quality. [Integration details](docs/guide.md) explain the three readout protocols.
